I am James Patrick De Ocampo, a dedicated student at Map√∫a University pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering. With a passion for technology and innovation, I have developed strong skills in web applications, Python programming, and Flask. I currently hold leadership positions as the Executive Secretary for the AWS Cloud Club at Map√∫a University Manila and the COO Representative for ICPEP.Se-Mapua University. Previously, I served as the Assistant Public Relations Head for ICPEP.Se-Mapua University.

In my journey to broaden my horizons and expand my knowledge, I am currently studying JavaScript, MongoDB, Node, and React. Additionally, I am diving into Software Architecture and Embedded Systems, areas that deviate from my core curriculum but excite me tremendously. My interests also extend to AI, software design, architecture, and software engineering, fields that I find fascinating and full of potential for future technological advancements.

I am continuously seeking opportunities to learn and grow, both academically and professionally, and I am eager to apply my skills and knowledge to create innovative solutions.
